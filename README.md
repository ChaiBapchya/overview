## Recommendations and Lessons Learned

1. Clearly establish toolset and processes before the event

In our case this wound up being:
- this Github organization
- specific formats of deliverables (eg. WARC)

_consider a crash course on tools (e.g. github for collaboration)_

2. Having infrastructure (VMs in advance)

3. Better definition of tasks and communication across teams

- Before the event aim to define goals/prioritized list
- At event consider having a group leads, and check-in or stand up meetings

4. Figure out what expertise you need!

- Clearly curate the tools that would be helpful and have people there who know them. In our case, WARCs were complicated.
