# Google Summer of Code

This is the ideas page for EDGI's Google Summer of Code program.

Our main repositories can be found on our [Github organization page](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/), with some additional explanation in [the Overview repo](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/)

Important -- to learn how to contribute to EDGI software, see our [Contributing to EDGI software page](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Who to contact

Development communication happens through archivers.slack.com, and Github issues. Generally, with programming related topics, reach out on Slack at `#next-steps`, or file an issue in thje appropriate Github repo. 

For pre-application inquiries, use `#gsoc`. For active Google Summer Code projects, use `#gsoc-projects`

## Contribution guidelines

Our Contributing to EDGI Software page has our preferred guidelines for submitting changes. Please read it over!

We also love it when students show that they can work well with us by checking out some of our easier issues in XXX, XXX, XXX, and even submitting a pull request. This gives us confidence that you've read our contribution guidelines and would be ready to jump into a project.

## How to post a proposal

(for students)

Please first contact the #gsoc channel in Slack, and tell us what you're interested in and a bit about your experience. It's also great to hear if you've forked one of our codebases) and installed it on a test server. Done with that? How about running tests? Tell us how far you've gotten!

Once your idea is more developed, please post a research note describing your proposal in detail. Tag it gsoc and gsoc-201[X]. Here is the template we used last year.

This To Be Updated for 2017: Post a proposal here -- and view proposals posted so far


# Ideas

## Machine Learning Algorithms for Website Tracking
- **Part of:** pagefreezer-cli
- **Description:** DESCRIBE - LINK https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/XXX/XXX
- **Contact:** archivers.slack.com, #next-steps
- **Prerequisites:** um.

1. Improving our government agency website monitoring;
 - Contextualize this into the whole tools for public engagement/journalism (like Document Cloud)
 - 4 months of development, active support with a partner agency to scope out project milestones
 - new features, optimization, visualization and data analysis
 - (Also API stuff? maybe like working in conjunction with developing API, defining tool for interacting, dev ops in terms of deployment of the infra to do the work?)

- **Description:** DESCRIBE - LINK https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/XXX/XXX
- **Contact:** 
- **Prerequisites:** Medeor/Node/Ruby on Rails/Python-scrapy/etc.
- Researching and prototyping a sustainable, accessible alternative to single-point-of-failure storage of scientific data.
 - Building partnerships with groups in this space (e.g., IPFS, Indie Web, and other decentralized technologies)
 - I think a critical part of this could be pitched as writing a report evaluating those considerations/concerns that  came out of NY. Doing some assessment of whether possible tools are an option via prototyping, writing test cases, load testing et al.
 - Not sure if this the right material for GSoC, maybe more web fellow?

3. Ask students to take a peak and propose a project from one of our current developments, is this allowed?
