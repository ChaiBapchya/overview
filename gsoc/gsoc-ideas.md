# Google Summer of Code

This is the ideas page for EDGI's Google Summer of Code program!

All newcomers to the project should review our [project introduction](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/) to learn more about where and how we work. Our repositories can be found on our [Github organization page](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/).

**Important Note**--to learn how to contribute to EDGI software, see our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contact Us

Most development communication happens on [archivers.slack.com](https://archivers.slack.com/), where anyone can [request an invite](https://archivers-slack.herokuapp.com/).

For project-related topics, reach out on Slack at `#dev`, or file an issue in the appropriate Github repo.

For GSoC application inquiries, use the `#gsoc` channel.

Matt Price ( [@titaniumbones](https://github.com/titaniumbones) | @mattprice) is the technical lead for the project.

## Contribute Improvements

We have [preferred guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for submitting changes. Please read it over!

We also love it when students show that they are excited to work with us by looking at some of our `first-timer` issues in our [pagefreezer-cli](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/pagefreezer-cli/labels/first-timer) or [guides](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/guides/labels/first-timer) repos and even submitting a pull request! This gives us confidence that you've read our contribution guidelines and would be ready to jump into a project.

## Submit a Proposal!

If you are interested in being a [GSoC student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/) with us, first join the `#gsoc` channel in Slack, and tell us what you're interested in and a bit about your experience.  

It's also great to hear if you've forked one of our codebases and set up a development environment. Done with that? How about running tests? Tell us how far you've gotten!

Once your idea is more developed, please submit a PR to [`overview/gsoc`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/gsoc) describing your proposal in detail. We have a [template]() for proposals.
