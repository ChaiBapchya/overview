# Project Guidelines

Each Project repository should have, at a minimum:

1. Contributing Guidelines, we use a [minimal template](#minimal-contributing-guidelines) that points to our main Contributing Guidelines and can be extended as needed to cover project-specific requirements.
1. License, we use GPLv3 as our _preferred_ license for code and Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA for creative works including documentation. It is **required** that all new repos are created with a license and copyright statement.
