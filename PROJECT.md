# Project Guidelines

Each project repository **require**, at a minimum:

1.  **Contributing Guidelines**  
We use a [minimal template](#minimal-contributing-guidelines) that points to our main Contributing Guidelines and can be extended as needed to cover project-specific requirements.

1.  **License**
[GPLv3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/) is our _preferred_ license for code and [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) for creative works and documentation.

We use a [License and Copyright block](#license-and-copyright-README-block) added to our READMEs, add a [LICENSE](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/LICENSE) to the repo, and occasionally include a [Code Header License block](#code-header-license-block).
